Based on your provided code for a clock application in Rust using the Chrono library, hereâ€™s a README that outlines its functionality, setup, and usage:

```markdown
# Rust Clock Application

A simple command-line clock application built in Rust using the [Chrono](https://crates.io/crates/chrono) library. This program continuously displays the current local time, refreshing every second.

## Features

- Displays the current local time in `HH:MM:SS` format.
- Refreshes the time display every second.
- Lightweight and easy to run.

## Requirements

- Rust (1.50.0 or newer)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

## Installation

To get started with the clock application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-clock.git
   cd rust-clock
   ```

2. Add the Chrono dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   chrono = "0.4"
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Usage

Simply run the application, and it will display the current local time, refreshing every second. The terminal will clear each time the time is updated.

## Example Output

```
Current time: 14:35:52
```

## Clearing the Terminal

The application attempts to clear the terminal output using ANSI escape codes. This may not work in all terminal environments, but it should function correctly in most Unix-based terminals.
